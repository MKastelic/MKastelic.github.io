    <h1>Adafruit Feather-Based Calculator</h1>
    <p>
        Originally written to provide a useful feature for a small Adafruit Feather-based “badge,” this calculator was implemented using Adafruit’s CircuitPython.  
        Intended to eventually utilize a touch-sensitized eINK display as the user interface, the project currently only supports a matrix keypad for input while 
        output is displayed via a serial communications terminal.
