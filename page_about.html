                        <p>I have spent the majority of my career in the high tech sector as an engineer enabling the fabrication of semiconductor chips.  Now I want to harness
                        the power of those devices and unleash my passion to craft code, bringing ideas to life.</p>
                        <p>I have always looked for opportunities to integrate my
                        passion for programming into every role I've held.  In one instance, an application I conceived and wrote was enthusiastically received by customers and 
                        quickly adopted by the business division I worked for to use on a global scale for their technical support teams.</p>
                        <p>That's what I call job satisfaction.  I never want to work another day in my life - and as long as I'm programming, I never will.
