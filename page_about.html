                        I have spent the majority of my career in the high tech sector as an engineer enabling the fabrication of semiconductor chips.  Now I want to harness
                        the power of those devices and unleash my passion to craft code, bringing ideas to life.  Since my exposure to machine language programming of process
                        control hardware for my senior thesis project as an undergraduate chemical engineering student, I have always looked for opportunities to integrate my
                        passion for programming into every role I've held.  As one example, while working for a large semiconductor equipment vendor, I saw the need to have a
                        utility which could translate the recipe files stored on our  process tools into a neatly formatted Excel workbook  replicating nearly identically what
                        was displayed on the tool's monitor.  Not only did our customers  respond enthusiastically to my application, but the business division I worked for adopted
                        its use on a global scale for their technical support teams.   That's what I call job satisfaction  I never want to work another day in my life - and as long
                        as I'm programming, I never will.
