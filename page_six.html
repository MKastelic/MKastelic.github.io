    <h1>C.A.T. Monitor</h1>
    <p>
        The Continuous Ambient Temperature (CAT) Monitor is an Adafruit Feather Huzzah-based temperature/humidity data logger
        with WiFi connectivity, capable of serving the data to a web pageon the internet. When the family cat was recently exiled to the outdoors for feline
        felonies committed within our house, our concern for his comfort led to this project’s conception. Now, anyone in the family can
        view the temperature of his external domicile (insulated domeshaped pet retreat fitted with a 60-watt heating pad), from anywhere and anytime.
