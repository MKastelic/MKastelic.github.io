        Based on the popular party game "CODENAMES" by Vlaada Chvatil, this electronic version crafted in Python replaces the static
        cardboard spymaster key card with a small mobile or tablet device running a web browser to provide a dynamic "decoder" during game
        play.  Untethered, by a static key, several optional variants (see <a href="https://github.com/MKastelic/Python_CodeNames_Game/blob/master/Assets/CodeName_New_Rules.pdf">New Rules</a>
        ) have been added to make this game even more fun and challenging:

            <p><b>Moles&nbsp</b>can be selected to appear randomly to replace existing blue or red agents, keeping everyone on their toes.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Double Agents&nbsp</b>allow spymasters a limited number of opportunities to denote an opposing team’s agent as a double agent and obtain credit if
                contact is made by the opposing team during their next turn.
